# tanstack-meta

A small library that transforms structured, Next.js [Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata)-like objects into metadata compatible with TanStack Router/Start, helping you manage document heads type-safely.

Here's an example of how you can use `tanstack-meta`.
While it makes the code slightly longer, it improves readability and clarity, and enables richer IDE type completion:

## Usage

```bash
npm install tanstack-meta
```

```ts
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { meta } from "tanstack-meta";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  head: () => {
    const { meta, links } = generateMetadata({
      charSet: "utf-8",
      title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      description: "Generated by create-tsrouter-app",
    });

    return {
      meta: [
        {
          name: "viewport",
          content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
        },
        ...meta,
      ],
      links,
    };
  },
  component: RootComponent,
})
```

You can generally use it the same way as Next.js’s `generateMetadata` function, but keep the following points in mind:

- Features that work across routes are not supported
  - `title` only accepts a plain string
  - `metadataBase` is not available
- `viewport` is not supported yet
